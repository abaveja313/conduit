//! abort.rs â€” Cooperative cancellation flag
//!
//! Invariants:
//! - Cheap to clone; all clones observe the same underlying state.
//! - Setting the flag is idempotent; once aborted, it stays set until `reset()`.
//!
//! Concurrency & Memory:
//! - Lock-free and thread-safe via `AtomicBool` with `SeqCst` for clarity.
//! - No allocation after construction; operations are O(1).
//!
//! Usage:
//! - Call `abort()` from a controller; poll `is_aborted()` in hot loops or long-running tasks.
//! - Use `reset()` only when intentionally reusing the same flag instance.
